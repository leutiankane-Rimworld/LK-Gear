# LK-Gear
---Gear repository of gear sets ill be making for my Human Plus mod's faction.

---All Gear is locked behind endgame research in the LK Gear tab

---Gear is appropriately expensive and relies more on my other mods like the mines 2.0 patch mod for resources to make the gear. 

---Added ULtimate Catapharact Armor

---Added Custom Parents for those items that didnt have them.

---See [Changelog.txt](https://github.com/leutiankane-Rimworld/LK-Gear/blob/main/LK%20Gear/About/ChangeLog.txt) in the About folder for full list of updates to this mod beyond what is listed here.
